Each file contains time-series data with columns such as:
- `'Date (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)`': Timestamp of the data.
- `'Date (J2000 mseconds)`': Time in milliseconds since J2000 epoch.
- Specific housekeeping parameters (e.g., temperatures, reset reasons).

### Examples of Parameters
- **LEM Satellite**:
  - `'SStates Loadshed'`
  - `'Tx ADC Temperature(Â°C)`'
- **HEWELIUSZ Satellite**:
  - `'EulerAngleErrors Data[0]'`
  - `'Telemetry WheelSpeed Value[0]`'

## Installation
To run the application, follow these steps:

1. **Download the application**
   - Obtain the `app.exe` file for Windows or `app` for Linux, located in the `win_app` and `linux_app` directories respectively.

2. **Run the executable**
   - For Windows, double-click `app.exe` to launch the application.
   - For Linux, navigate to the `linux_app` directory and run `./app` from the terminal.

3. **System Requirements**
   - Windows 8 or later, or a modern Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu 20.04+).
   - At least 8GB of RAM (recommended for larger datasets).
   - Python 3.9+ with `matplotlib` and `pandas` installed (if using the source code).

## Using the Application

### Step 1: Loading Data
1. Launch the application by running the executable file.
2. Click the **Browse** button to select the folder containing your satellite data files.

### Step 2: Configuring the Parser
1. Use the **Start Year** and **End Year** fields to filter data by year. These fields are optional and can be left empty to include all available data.
2. Select a **File Pattern** to narrow down the type of data you want to parse (e.g., "0-Power Board").
3. Check the desired columns in the **Select Columns** section to include them in the output.
4. Choose a processing mode:
   - **Single-process mode**: Processes files one by one (useful for small datasets).
   - **Parallel processing mode**: Enables faster processing by using multiple CPU cores. You can specify the number of tasks in the **Parallel Tasks** field.

### Step 3: Running the Parser
1. Click **Run Parser** to start the data processing.
2. Monitor the progress using the progress bar and file count indicator.
3. Once completed, the parsed data will be ready for plotting or saving.

### Step 4: Plotting Data
1. Click **Plot Data** to open the column selection window. The plot is interactive and allows zooming without losing quality.
2. Choose one or more columns to plot.
3. Select a scale:
   - **Linear**: Standard scale.
   - **Logarithmic**: For data with a wide range of values.
4. View the interactive plot. Use the red cursor to inspect specific points.

### Optional: Saving Parsed Data
1. Click **Save Parsed File** to export the parsed data as a CSV file.
2. Choose the destination and filename in the save dialog.
